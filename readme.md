# roaming-rocket
This is a simple simulation of rocket that is roaming in space. Made with P5Js
<br>

# Logic in Breif
For making illusion that rocket is moving I have move stars opposite according to rocket angle and change the rocket angle and star velocity according to key moves like for <b>RIGHT ARROW</b> key the angle will increase by 1 and etc.

# ScreenShot
